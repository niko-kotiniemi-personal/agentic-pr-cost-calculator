"""Each decision has a record of its own, and the records hold together.

`docs/decisions/` keeps one record for each decision about what the tool is,
how it works and how it is built, so that each decision can be reversed or
replaced on its own. A record holds one choice. Its fields say what kind of
decision it is, whether it still holds, who made it, and which requirements,
threats and other records it touches; its sections say why it was made, what
else was considered, what follows from it, what it covers, and what reversing
it would change. `docs/decisions/README.md` is the index.

These tests hold what a machine can check:

- every record has its fields and its sections, each once, in order, none of
  them empty, and no other line that starts with `#`; its type, status and
  decider take a form from their lists, and a date that it gives is a real one,
  no later than today; its file name and heading carry its number, in ASCII
  digits padded to three; and it holds plain text: printable ASCII and line
  breaks, with no fenced block, no `<`, `][` or table outside inline code, no
  web address or link reference definition, and no link but from a record's ID
  to that record's file;
- the records' folder holds the records and their index and nothing else, no
  link among them, no file elsewhere is named as a record, and the numbers run
  from DR-001 without a gap or a repeat;
- the index lists every record once, in order, as the record itself has it,
  and every line of its table, which runs to its first blank line, is a row
  that it reads;
- every requirement and threat that a record lists is held or retired, a
  closed record and the record that closed it name each other, and an accepted
  record does not rest only on retired requirements;
- every record and design decision that a tracked file outside `vendor/` and
  `tests/` names exists, a parenthesis right after a record's ID gives that
  record's title, and only the records, the index, the changelog and archived
  changes name a closed one;
- every requirement, threat, change and task that such a file names, if it is
  Markdown, exists, a requirement or a threat held or retired;
- each threat that an accepted record lists names that record in its Held by
  line, and a threat that names a new record there is listed in it;
- no attribute of the repository's changes how git or GitHub shows a record's
  diff;
- a record that the default branch holds is never removed, and never changed
  except to be closed, after which any line of text under its sections may
  become `[removed]`; and an ID that the default branch's register or threat
  model holds stays held or retired, an ID counting as retired only where the
  section "Retired IDs" lists it.

Whether a record holds one choice, describes rather than instructs, and says
what its sources say is for the review to check.

The comparison with the default branch compares git trees, not the working
tree, so a change counts once it is committed. It compares with where HEAD left
`refs/remotes/origin/main` and, in CI, with the base commit that the workflow
names in `BASE_COMMIT` too, since a pull request's base is whichever branch its
author chose. By design, the comparison skips while no base holds the records'
folder, which is the case until the first records reach the default branch,
and fails when a base holds that folder and no file in it that these tests name
a record.
