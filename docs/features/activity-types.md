# Activity types

Each recorded call carries one label for the kind of work it did, so that the report can split the cost by activity.

**Status:** designed, not built yet.

**Spec:** `activity-types`

**Requirements:** R6

## Expected behaviour

The label comes from the first tool the call used:

| The call's first tool | Activity type |
|---|---|
| A file edit or write | code generation |
| A read or a search | file reading |
| A shell command | tooling |
| An MCP tool (`mcp__…`) | MCP |
| Starting a subagent | subagent |
| A tool the classification does not know | other |
| No tool at all | conversation |

The tool's name is read only to choose the label. It is never recorded, because an MCP server's name can name a private service.

## Not covered

- Code review, which cannot be told apart from other work by tool names alone.

## How it is validated

This feature is validated first by its spec's scenarios: each gets an acceptance test before its code, seen to fail for the expected reason (task 1.4). Then come the checks that DR-084 to DR-093 and DR-109 apply to all the tool's code. Beyond those, this feature has its own:

- Synthetic transcripts with each kind of tool call, an MCP call among them, and a call whose tools are of several types (task 1.1), and the tests of the classification itself (task 2.5).
