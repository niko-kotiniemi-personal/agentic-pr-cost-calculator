# Turning it on, and personal opt-in

Two switches decide whether anything is recorded. The repository decides whether the tool is used there, and each person decides whether their own sessions' usage is published.

**Status:** designed, not built yet.

**Spec:** `switch-and-opt-in`

**Requirements:** R1, R36, R37, R103, R104, R105, R38, R106, R39, R40, R107, R108, R109, R110, R19, R91, R92, R93

## Expected behaviour

- A repository turns the tool on by adding `.pr-cost.json` at its root with `enabled` set to true, and off by removing the file or setting `enabled` to false.
- A person turns capture on for themselves by setting `pr-cost.capture` to `true` in their global git configuration: `~/.gitconfig`, or git's file in their XDG configuration folder. Nothing in a repository can turn it on for them, so an outside contributor's usage is never committed because a repository's owner turned the tool on.
- Setting `pr-cost.capture` to `false` in one repository's own git configuration turns capture off there. Setting it to `true` there opts no one in.
- Capture records nothing unless both switches are on. Each run notes in the store, inside the git directory, whether it found both on, and only calls made while both were on are recorded: calls made before a person opts in, or while capture was off, are never recorded later, and calls recorded before an opt-out are not staged after it. A ledger file staged before capture was turned off is still taken back.
- `pr-cost.capture` opts a person in only as `true`, `yes`, `on`, `1` or the bare key. Any other value, including ones that git itself reads as true, such as `2`, does not.
- The report reads `.pr-cost.json` from the default branch as it was before the merge and as it is after, and runs when either turns the tool on. So a pull request cannot turn off its own report, and the pull request that turns the tool on gets one.
- A pull request that changes `.pr-cost.json`, any workflow file or the hook file has that change flagged in its comment.

## How it is validated

This feature is validated first by its spec's scenarios: each gets an acceptance test before its code, seen to fail for the expected reason (task 1.4). Then come the checks that design decision 8 applies to all the tool's code. Beyond those, this feature has its own:

- Tests that try each way that a repository or its environment could opt a person in, and check that capture stays off: the repository's own git configuration, git's environment variables, an included file, and a relative configuration folder (task 2.4).
- Tests that the report reads `.pr-cost.json` from before and after the merge, including a file that a pull request makes unreadable (task 4.1).
