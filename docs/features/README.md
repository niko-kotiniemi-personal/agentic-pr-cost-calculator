# Features

What the calculator consists of, one page per feature, from the side of the person who uses it. Each page says what the feature does, how it is expected to behave, and which requirements in [`../requirements.md`](../requirements.md) it holds. How the features fit together as one product is in [`../how-it-works.md`](../how-it-works.md).

The calculator is designed and not built yet, so each page describes the behaviour the specs require. A page changes in the same pull request as the feature it describes.

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| [Turning it on, and personal opt-in](switch-and-opt-in.md) | A repository turns the tool on with one file; each person decides whether their own sessions are recorded. |
| [Usage capture](usage-capture.md) | Records each model call's token counts during a Claude Code session and commits them with the agent's work. |
| [Activity types](activity-types.md) | Labels each call as code generation, file reading, tooling, MCP, subagent, conversation or other. |
| [The usage ledger](ledger.md) | The small files that carry the counts to the pull request and stay as its record. |
| [Pricing](pricing.md) | Prices the tokens from a dated table, by token type and with the price modifiers. |
| [CI minutes](ci-minutes.md) | Adds the GitHub Actions minutes that the pull request's own commits used. |
| [The report comment](report-comment.md) | Posts one comment with the cost when the pull request merges. |
| [Releases and compatibility](releases-and-compatibility.md) | Which Python versions the tool runs on, and how versions are released. |
