# Requirements

Every requirement the tool must meet, in one list. The specs under `openspec/` hold each requirement's full text and the scenarios that test it; this register is their index, so that what the product must do can be read in one place. `tests/test_documentation.py` checks that the register and the specs hold the same requirements, each once.

Each requirement has one kind:

- **functional:** what the tool does.
- **behavioural:** how it responds to conditions, failures and inputs it must refuse.
- **non-functional:** a quality it must keep, such as privacy, security, compatibility, or how it is released and documented.

The capability names the spec that holds the requirement. Each capability is one feature, and each requirement is on its capability's page in [`features/`](features/README.md).

| R133 | non-functional | `project-standards` | The records' folder holds only the records and their index |
| R134 | non-functional | `project-standards` | No attribute hides a record's diff |

IDs are stable: a requirement keeps its ID while it exists, and a new one takes the next free number, so the rows follow the order in which requirements were added rather than the order of the specs. A requirement that a later change removes leaves the table, and its ID is listed below with the change that removed it, never to be used again.

## Retired IDs

None yet. An entry names the ID and the change that removed it, as in "R7, removed by `change-name`".
