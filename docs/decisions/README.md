# Decision records

Each decision about what the tool is, how it works and how it is built has a record of its own here, so that each can be reversed or replaced on its own. A record holds one choice: why it was made, what else was considered, what follows from it, what it covers, and what reversing it would change. Its fields say what kind of decision it is, whether it still holds, who decided it, and the requirements of `docs/requirements.md` and the threats of `docs/threat-model.md` that it shapes.

A record that the default branch holds is accepted, and from then on it changes only by being closed, by a record that replaces it, after which lines of its text may become `[removed]`. Design decision 13 of `add-pr-cost-calculator` describes the form and the checks that `tests/test_decisions.py` holds. Within a record, the design, the proposal and the tasks named without a change are those of the change that added the record.
