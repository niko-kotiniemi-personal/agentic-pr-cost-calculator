# DR-056: Capture does not read the branch's history

- **Type:** security and privacy
- **Status:** accepted
- **Decided by:** the owner, 2026-10-19
- **Requirements:** R2, R45, R52, R81
- **Threats:** T2, T19
- **Replaces:** none
- **Closed by:** none

## Context

Capture keeps the calls it has recorded, and the notes that keep a removed ledger file's calls out (DR-055), in its store, inside one clone's git directory (DR-011), so a fresh clone, such as one where a session is resumed, has none of them (T19). A file that a later commit removes stays in git history, though, where a fresh clone could still find it (T2).

## Decision

Capture learns which calls are already recorded only from its store and from the ledger files that the branch holds, and it does not read the branch's history.

## Alternatives

- Treating as recorded the calls of every ledger file in the branch's history, which the owner turned down on 2026-10-19, and which would work in a fresh clone that holds that history too, but would keep a removed file's calls out only when a later commit removed the file, whose content that history then still holds, and not when a rewrite of that history removed it, and would have the step read the history of `.pr-cost/` before it stages.

## Consequences

- A session resumed in a fresh clone does not record again a call that its branch's ledger files already hold, since capture reads the hashes in those files, as git blobs within the size bound (R2, R45, T19).
- A session resumed in a fresh clone at the same path can stage again the calls of a ledger file that its branch no longer holds, undoing a removal made for privacy (R52, T2), which task 4.4 has the README's section on adopting the tool say.
- DR-055 was decided knowing of this gap, as its Context says.

## Scope

This covers what capture reads to tell which calls are already recorded. How it identifies a call is DR-033 (A call is identified by its message id) and DR-136 (Only a hash of a call's message id is kept). Keeping out the calls of a file that a run found in a commit, within one clone, is DR-055 (Calls of a ledger file found in a commit are never staged again). The report reads the call ids of the default branch's first-parent history so that a call is counted once across pull requests, which is DR-131 (A call counts at most once in the default branch's history).

## What reversing it would change

R52 in `usage-capture` would change, with its scenario "A fresh clone stages a removed ledger file's calls again", and so would R2's scenario "A resumed session records nothing its branch already holds", R81, which names the calls that capture stages, R45, which says how capture reads ledger files from git, the design's decision 1 and its risk "[A person removes a ledger file from their branch, or a commit that holds one is undone]", T2's residual, T19's answer, the README's section on adopting the tool (task 4.4) and tasks 2.1 and 2.2. DR-055 would be revisited.
